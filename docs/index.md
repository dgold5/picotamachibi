# Welcome to Picotamachibi
This is the code for the Picotamachibi virtual pet.
The pet will start out as an egg and hatch into a baby (chibi) creature.

You can feed your pet by selecting the Food icon using button a, and pressing the select button (button b).
Pressing button X will cancel the current selection.

After eating food, you pets energy level will increase, along with its happiness level. It will poop after an amount of time has passed.
leaving the poop on screen will eventually lead to the happiness level decreasing.

If the energy level and happiness level stay at zero for too long, your pet will die. :(
